# pg-live-query

### This package has been deprecated. Please use [pg-live-select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-live-select).

This package exposes the `LiveSQL` class in order to provide realtime result sets for PostgreSQL `SELECT` statements.

## Implements

### LiveSQL Class

The `LiveSQL` constructor requires 2 arguments:

Constructor Argument | Type | Description
---------|------|---------------------------
`connectionString` | `string` | ex. `postgres://user:pass@host/db`
`channel` | `string` | Unique identifier for this connection. Used as channel for `NOTIFY` commands as well as prefix for triggers, functions, and views. Must follow SQL naming rules: may only contain `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `_` and not begin with a number.

A single persistent client is used to listen for notifications. Result set refreshes obtain additional clients from the pool on-demand.

Each instance offers the following asynchronous methods (both return Promises):

Method | Returns | Description
-------|---------|-----------------
`select(query, params, onUpdate)` | `{ stop() }` handle `Object` | Call `onUpdate` with new data on initialization and each change. `query` only accepts string. Optional `params` argument accepts array.
`cleanup()` | *Undefined* | Drop all table triggers and close all connections.

## Simple Example

1. Run `npm install` to download dependent packages.

2. Load `join-example.sql` into Postgres. Change the owner user from 'meteor', if needed.

3. Configure the database connection string and query in `src/index2.es6`.

4. Then run `npm run make && node lib/index2.js` to build the ES6 files and start the app at index2.js.
